## Hi, I am MacTash 👋

🔐 Future AI Security Engineer
🧪 Focused on learning AI/LLM Security, Cybersecurity amongst other things!

🎯 Building tools that protect and strengthen AI systems in the real world

## What I work on

🚩 AI Red Teaming
🛡️ LLM Threat Detection
🧠 Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Research
📊 Analyst focused feature design for security tooling
🌏 OSINT work and investigations (when I am bored)

I love creating security tools that actually do something, not just sit in a folder.

## What drives me

⚡ Adaptive mindset
📚 Constant upskilling
🛠️ If I want something to exist, I build it

## Currently building

🛰️ AI Model Security Scanner
Repository coming public soon, stay tuned for version one.
I am designing it to detect and visualize risks in large language model behavior.

Web-Cross
CLI based web vulnerability attack with massive payload library.
Designed to assess vulnerabilities, not attack and provide a detailed and professional remediation guide.
